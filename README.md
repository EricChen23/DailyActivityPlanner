# Daily Activity Planner

The designer of this application **used to be** very good at procrastinating and forgetting things.
His life was a mess until one day his friend told him to start using planners. His life changed rapidly
ever since he started using planners to organize his life. Now, he is reformed, and he wants to help 
others reform too. 

For all of you who like to procrastinate a lot, this application will help you live a better life!
